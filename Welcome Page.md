# Welcome
This page is dedicated to gathering information about Ericsson space at BTH in one place, to make it easier for students who are engaged as Labrats in the lab or for students who wish to know more about Ericsson space as a whole.  Students do not stay studying forever, and therefore some knowledge should be preserved for future students. 

This site may come to change quite often.
